# my code for electricity and magnetism

In this repository I put my e and m related code

## these pictures are from assignment 1
GIF of charges
![check out this cool that i made for assignment 1](charges.gif)
twelve positive charges around a circle with 13 slots
![twelve positive charges around a circle with 13 slots](12positive_charges.png)
one negative charge in the missing slot, gives the same field, we deduce this from principle of superposition

## these pictures are from assignment 2
The electric field multiplied, modified slightly to make it look nicer
![fake electric field plot](e_field_fake_plot_gaussian_distrubuted_charge_cross_section.png)
The electric field as it actually is
![real electric field plot](e_field_real_plot_gaussian_distrubuted charge_cross_section.png)
The electirc potential, cross section in yz plane, the chared square lies in x,y plane, as for the two above pictures

The electric potential near the plate
