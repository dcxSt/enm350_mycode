# my code for electricity and magnetism

In this repository I put my e and m related code

## Assignment 10 pictures
The coding question for pset 10 was to - for an arbitrary loop of current - find the magnetic vector potential. I went a step further and made a thing that gives you quiver plot of both the vector potential, and then uses finite element to approximate derivatives and find magnetic field too. See below quiver plots. The code (ps10bonus.py) also prompts the user to input a coordinate once they have selected their curve of choice, and returns the numerical value of both the vector potential and the magnetic field at the point you enter.

GIF of charges
![check out this cool that i made for assignment 1](charges.gif)
twelve positive charges around a circle with 13 slots

one negative charge in the missing slot, gives the same field, we deduce this from principle of superposition

## these pictures are from assignment 2
The electric field multiplied, modified slightly to make it look nicer

The electric field as it actually is

The electirc potential, cross section in yz plane, the chared square lies in x,y plane, as for the two above pictures
